Focus-Develop
It is a collection of open-source projects covering multiple languages and scenarios, aiming to provide developers with
an "out-of-the-box" project framework and tools, helping users skip the cumbersome basic construction stage and quickly
enter the core business logic development. Its core design concept is minimalism and modularization. Through a layered
architecture, standardized protocols, and flexible expansion mechanisms, it is compatible with mainstream development
scenarios such as the cloud, mobile terminals, and microservices, while also being compatible with multiple programming
languages and toolchains.

***"Focus-Develop It is not only a collection of tools, but also the practice of the development concept - to bring
technology back to the essence of business."***
